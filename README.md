#Standalone mod or Overhaul - Your choice!
The mod has 2 different modes, which can be choosen in mod settings. As standalone 248k won't change vanila and can be added to existing saves without any problems. The overhaul mode will integrate 248k items, techs and buildings into vanila and also into Krastorio 2 progression. Especially with Krastorio 2 the overhaul mode will extend the gameplay by some time. 

#Mod Stages
248k is sperated in 4 different stages: Electronic - Fission - Fusion - Exotic. Each one introduces new machines, materials aswell as unique ways to produce energy.
Increasing in complexity/scale with every stage.

#Ore Washing

Since the mod doesn't add any world gen. features all ores must be washed out of the standard ones.
Some of the newly introduced materials contain f.e. titanium, neodymium or gold. 


#KI Tech

One major feature of 248k are the KI cores. These allow to brodecast module effects from modules inside the KI core to linked beacons.
Therefore one can safe modules in expense of keeping the core running. 
Over the time these KI cores will get cheaper and more powerfull!

#New Machinery

#The Goal
To unofficially complete the mod simply craft one 248k element, easy ins't it? Maybe not, considering that before you will have to complete all 4 stages and aquire some insane amounts of power and science.
